Etch-a-sketch which gives random colours as you pass through cells. This was made using Javascript and functionally it
sets an initial grid, with the option to remove that grid and redraw it to a given size on button push. The logic
for drawing the grid and it's individual cells follows.
The event listener beneath adds an additional class to the cells on 'hover' to give them randomised RGB values using
math.floor(math.random).
